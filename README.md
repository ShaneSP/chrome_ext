## Todo Chrome Ext.

### About
This is a personal project, the goal of which was to learn Chrome ext. API and create a Chrome tool that I can add functionality to as I would like. For now, I am interested in expanding the todo-list functionality. However, I have some ideas for other helpful tools I can add later.

### Functionality
* Add and remove items on a todo-list.

### Next Steps
* Add ability to modify todo-list from ext. pop-up.
* Research Google Calendar API for dated todo-items.
* Drag-and-drop reordering
* Sub-items
